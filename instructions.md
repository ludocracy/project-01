## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For your first project you will build a **full stack web application** using jQuery and AJAX, Express, Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a full-stack web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.  
* Build a polished, published website you can share in your portfolio.  

You will be working **in groups** for this first project. Show us what you've got!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Express API** Build an Express Application that has JSON endpoints.
* **RESTful Routes** Design your CRUD routes using the [REST](http://restfulrouting.com/mappings/resources) convention.
* **AJAX** Leverage AJAX to fetch JSON data from the backend.
* **jQuery** Use jQuery to add interactivity and render data on the client-side.  
* **Templating** Render the JSON data on the frontend using ES6 String literals or on the backend using EJS.  
* **MongoDB** Persist at least _two models_ to a Mongo Database. Use at least one one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between models. You can choose to reference or embed your data.  
* **Git** 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed. (And don't expose any secret keys/tokens on GitHub!)
* **Visual Design** You must use semantically clean HTML and CSS. You can also use Bootstrap, Foundation, or another CSS framework to make your front-end snazzy. First impressions matter!
* **Heroku** Deploy your app to Heroku.
* **Documentation** Write a README.md that would make an employer excited to hire you. Screenshots are encouraged. See the [example readme](./example-readme.md) for a suggested structure.

## PLANNING DELIVERABLES

See the [planning deliverables](./planning.md) document for more information on the planning steps you should take.
  * A clearly defined **Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) Scope**. What can you reasonably accomplish in a week?
  * **Wireframes** for _every_ page. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the page will include.
  * **User Stories** (divided into sprints) - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
  * **Database Models and ERD** Make plans for each resource.  List the attributes you'll include in your schemas and what type of data each attribute will be. Draw an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=database%20table%20relationships%20drawing) to illustrate the relationship(s) between models, and note whether you plan to reference or embed related data.


Once your project has been approved, create a **GitHub Repo** for your project and [add your teaching team as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

## BONUS IDEAS  
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app, but *please talk to an instructor* beforehand:

* **Front-End Data Validation** Validate data on the front-end by handling incorrect form inputs during create/update. For example, when a form is submitted, check that a field has some text in it, or that its value is a number.
* **Back-End Data Validation** Validate data on the back-end using mongoose's [built-in validations](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html#built-in-validators), or make your own custom validation.
* **More Models or Relationships** Add another model to your project or create a new relationship.
* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Model Methods** Level up your models by adding a method to one of your schemas.  For example, a person schema with `firstName` and `lastName` can have a `fullName` method (see mongoose docs on [instance methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) and [static methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics)).
* **Authentication** Enable users to store account information and signup, login, and logout.
* **Sass** Use a CSS pre-compiler to write more imperative CSS.
* **Whatever else inspires you!**

## TIMELINE

> DO NOT START CODING UNTIL YOUR PROJECT IS APPROVED.

* **Friday, October 13th by 3:00pm** - Present your app plan to your instructors. Before you begin work on your project, the [planning deliverables](./planning.md) must be checked off with an instructor!
* **Weekdays: October 16th - 20th** - Class Standups @ 9:30am.
* **Thursday, October 19th 4:00pm** - Feature Freeze! Deploy your code to Heroku, and start polishing existing features. Finalize your `README.md` and prepare for presentations.
* **Friday, October 20th @ 9:30am** - Project due and presentations!

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

#### Code must be...
* Clean   
  - no unused or commented-out code   
  - proper spacing and indentation  
* Modular and well organized   
  - use the module pattern with `module.exports`  
  - separate large tasks into shorter functions
* Appropriately commented
  - use comments to plan, but remove the unnecessary comments for your professional portfolio
  - prefer a well-named variable or function to a comment

## ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS
We will be checking github for issues and hold 1:1s throughout the week. We will also do mini lessons on certain topics if we notice that several people are running into the same issues.

## FINAL DELIVERABLES

* Completion of the **core requirements**
* A link to your website **hosted on Heroku**
* A link to your **source code on GitHub**
* A `README.md` file that serves as your **project documentation** (this is important!)
* A **brief presentation**, in the company of friends, illustrating:
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - Words of Wisdom
    - And _3_ lines(!) of code you want to share with your classmates

## PROJECT FEEDBACK + DELIVERABLES

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

* **Project Workflow:** Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

* **Deployment and Functionality:** Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

## Presentation Tips
* Please zoom your browser window to 150%.
* Please set your Atom font to at least 20.0 pixels.
* And speak up!

### HAPPY CODING :)
